# laptop-findr
A website created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap and PHP that is used to find the best laptop deals given constraints such as cost, brand, processor, etc.  I worked on the majority of the PHP backend, dealing with login/logout, adding/removing the user's favourite laptops to the MySQL database system, and using AJAX to populate the page with the laptops dynamically using information obtained from the noteb.com API.
